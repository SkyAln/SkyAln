# Hi there!üëã I‚Äôm @SkyAln

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about cybersecurity, robotics, and artificial intelligence. I thrive on exploring theoretical concepts and constantly expanding my knowledge through reading and learning. Here's a bit more about me:

## üîß My Skills & Interests
- **Cybersecurity:** I have a keen interest in securing digital systems and networks. My skills include penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, SOC analysing and security best practices.

- **Robotics:** I love working with robots and exploring the intersection of hardware and software. From building simple bots to experimenting with advanced robotic systems, I enjoy the challenges that robotics brings. i am experienced on working on three different robots.

- **Artificial Intelligence:** I'm fascinated by the potential of AI to solve complex problems. My interests span machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. I have worked on computer vision on quad copter for deceting faces and objects.

- **Theoretical Enthusiast:** I thrive on understanding the theoretical foundations behind technologies. Whether it's diving into algorithms, exploring mathematical concepts, or pondering the future of AI, I enjoy the intellectual aspects of technology.

- **Continuous Learner:** I'm always reading and learning. I believe in the power of staying curious and constantly expanding my knowledge horizons.

## ü§ñ Robotics Projects

### 1. Line Following Robot
I have developed a line-following robot capable of tracking and following a predefined path. This robot participated in a regional competition, securing the first place twice. 
This project not only showcased my skills in robotics but also resulted in winning the top position in the regional competition.

### 2. Quadcopter Project
I have hands-on experience in programming quadcopters, which included integrating flight controllers and implementing computer vision algorithms for the quadcopter to recognize predefined faces and objects. This quadcopter was designed collaboratively with my friends specifically for the national robotic competition, Iran Open.

These projects reflect my passion for robotics and the practical application of theoretical concepts.
